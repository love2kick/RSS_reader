            <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1986, a young woman named Ruby Doss is found strangled to death in the East Sprague area of Spokane, Washington. For decades, similarities between Ruby&#8217;s death and a string of other murders in the area send investigators chasing false leads. It seems like justice for Ruby is a lost cause, until a completely unrelated crime in another state blows the case wide open.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MURDERED: Shawn Edwards Part 1</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When 14-year-old Shawn Edwards is stabbed and beaten to death outside of a high school in Middletown, NY, the whole community is shocked.

            <title>INFAMOUS: Circleville Letters</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;An anonymous letter-writer antagonized residents of Circleville, Ohio for years, singling out the school superintendent, Gordon Massie, and a local bus driver, Mary Gillispie, as the focus of much of the vitriol. When Mary finds a booby trap with a loaded gun in 1983, the gun is traced to her brother-in-law Paul Freshour &#8211; but the letters would continue long after Paul went to prison for attempted murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find the ASL version of this episode &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CrimeJunkie"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <itunes:summary>In January 2010 JoAnn Matouk Romain runs a quick errand to get gas followed by attending a 15-minute prayer service, then she walks into the freezing lake across the street to take her own life.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;When Megan Kanka went missing in 1994 her case exposed one of the holes in the sex offender registry. Yes, people were registered but that was only known to government officials, not to those living among potential predators.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;When Jacob Wetterling went missing in 1989 one of the first thoughts police had, was to track down all the local violent sex offenders in the area to see if they could be potential suspects. But this was easier said than done because back then there was no centralized database for this sort of thing. Jacob&#8217;s case went unsolved for decades and his mom always wondered if her son fell through the cracks of a system without enough regulation. So, she worked to set a&#160;&lt;strong&gt;precedent&lt;/strong&gt;&#160;that would require all sex offenders to be registered.

            <title>MURDERED: Meredith Kercher</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;A 21yo British woman is less than a month into a foreign exchange in Perugia, Italy when she is brutally murdered in her apartment. Everyone&#8217;s world is turned upside-down. And for the woman who found herself in the center of the storm -- and on trial for murder -- it has stayed that way ever since. My question is: Why, all these years later -- long after the courts have spoken -- are we still talking about Amanda Knox?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MURDERED: The Hendricks Family</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, David Hendricks was the walking embodiment of the true crime trope "The Husband Did It." After his family was brutally murdered in their Illinois home back in 1983, police were quick to zero in on him as their main suspect despite the lack of evidence and mostly because... nothing else made any sense. Decades later some still believe in his guilt but knowing what we know now can you still be so sure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>INFAMOUS: Armored Truck Heists</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Robbing an armored truck is one of the most difficult and dangerous crimes someone can commit. These illegal acts take patience, precision and planning...skills most run-of-the mill robbers don&#8217;t possess. If a suspect is successful, the payoff can be millions of dollars all at once, which is why throughout the decades some men and women have tried to execute the perfect plan to net one of these mobile money pots. In this 10-part series host of Disgraceland, Jake Brennan details some of the most daring and deadly armored truck heists in history that left lasting marks on society and law enforcement agencies across the world. From Audiochuck and executive producer Delia D&#8217;Ambra, Armored is an in-depth, research-based original podcast and the first two episodes are out RIGHT NOW!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out all the episodes right here at &lt;a href="https://armoredpodcast.com/"&gt;https://armoredpodcast.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Todas las ganancias ir&#225;n directamente a la organizaci&#243;n.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week\'s episode involves a missing girl who police believe may be in Mexico right now as a victim of human trafficking. That\'s why, for the first time, we&#8217;re releasing this episode in Spanish AND English. Hosted by Melanie and Emmanuel, our hope is that the Spanish-language version of Alicia\'s story will help us reach even more people -- hopefully the right people who can help bring this young girl back home to her family.

            <title>SEASON OF JUSTICE!!!</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Audiochuck&#8217;s founder and CEO, Ashley Flowers, has founded a new non-profit called Season of Justice. Season of Justice (SOJ) is dedicated to providing funding to law enforcement agencies and families to help solve cold cases. SOJ provides grants to law enforcement for advanced DNA analysis solutions, such as forensic genealogy and next-generation sequencing. The organization also awards grants to families to support awareness campaigns, search teams and other initiatives that can assist in pushing their cold cases forward. SOJ&#8217;s goal is to provide financial resources for both law enforcement and families in order to bring closure to those impacted by unsolved violent crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Season of Justice is completely separate from audiochuck, it&#8217;s because of Crime Junkie listeners that we have been able to fund the organization so far. Every time you&#8217;ve ordered merch, signed up for the fan club or just listened to one of our ads on Crime Junkie we have donated to SOJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of you we have already been able to award $145,000 in grants to assist with 25 cold cases. And that&#8217;s JUST the beginning. We expect to award another $75,000 to $100,000 through the rest of this year and hopefully much more in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At audiochuck, we believe we have a responsibility to do more than just tell these stories. We believe you as listeners have a responsibility to do more than just listen. We really wanted to be able to move the needle in the true crime space and create responsible true crime content and we are doing that together. Because of you and because of this show, we will all be directly responsible for making a difference. For making sure justice is served. For doing right by the people whose stories we tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#8217;ve been here since day one or you just found our show &#8211; THANK YOU. Thank you for being a part of this journey. And thank you for helping us making a lasting responsible impact in the true crime space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audiochuck will always continue to use the funds brought in by our fans to support Season of Justice and other non-profits and cases that are important to us and our listeners, but if you want to donate directly you can visit the website Seasonofjustice.org. Season of Justice is a 501(c)(3) and all donations are tax-deductible.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement, victims and families can also submit grant applications on the website for funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day we hope to wake up and say there are no more cold cases&#8230; That won&#8217;t be tomorrow, but there is a future where that&#8217;s possible. And thank you for making that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Season of Justice (SOJ) is dedicated to providing funding to law enforcement agencies and families to help solve cold cases. SOJ provides grants to law enforcement for advanced DNA analysis solutions, such as forensic genealogy and next-generation sequencing. The organization also awards grants to families to support awareness campaigns, search teams and other initiatives that can assist in pushing their cold cases forward. SOJ&#8217;s goal is to provide financial resources for both law enforcement and families in order to bring closure to those impacted by unsolved violent crimes.Though Season of Justice is completely separate from audiochuck, it&#8217;s because of Crime Junkie listeners that we have been able to fund the organization so far. Every time you&#8217;ve ordered merch, signed up for the fan club or just listened to one of our ads on Crime Junkie we have donated to SOJ.Because of you we have already been able to award $145,000 in grants to assist with 25 cold cases. And that&#8217;s JUST the beginning. We expect to award another $75,000 to $100,000 through the rest of this year and hopefully much more in the years to come.At audiochuck, we believe we have a responsibility to do more than just tell these stories. We believe you as listeners have a responsibility to do more than just listen. We really wanted to be able to move the needle in the true crime space and create responsible true crime content and we are doing that together. Because of you and because of this show, we will all be directly responsible for making a difference. For making sure justice is served. For doing right by the people whose stories we tell.Whether you&#8217;ve been here since day one or you just found our show &#8211; THANK YOU. Thank you for being a part of this journey. And thank you for helping us making a lasting responsible impact in the true crime space.Audiochuck will always continue to use the funds brought in by our fans to support Season of Justice and other non-profits and cases that are important to us and our listeners, but if you want to donate directly you can visit the website Seasonofjustice.org. Season of Justice is a 501(c)(3) and all donations are tax-deductible.&#160;Law enforcement, victims and families can also submit grant applications on the website for funding.One day we hope to wake up and say there are no more cold cases&#8230; That won&#8217;t be tomorrow, but there is a future where that&#8217;s possible. And thank you for making that happen.</itunes:summary>

            <title>INFAMOUS: Prom Night Murders</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the small town of Lakeville, Indiana was rocked by the massacre of a pastor and his family. The pastor\'s only surviving son was ultimately convicted of this infamous crime but there is more to this twisted story than has ever been told before. On April 29th, 2021 (the 32nd anniversary of the crime) the audiochuck original podcast &lt;a href="https://counterclockpodcast.com/"&gt;CounterClock&lt;/a&gt; will be releasing 20 episodes on this case to binge! Listen and determine for yourself if Jeff Pelley is guilty and right where he should be, serving a life sentence in prison. OR... if a pastor\'s secret past caught up to him and his son was wrongfully convicted for the crime.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF: Holly Bartlett</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On a cold day in March 2010, workers discovered a woman lying unconscious under the MacKay Bridge in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada - barely breathing and clinging to life. It was 31-year-old Holly Bartlett. Police say she walked almost a quarter of a mile from the front door of her condo building, where she crawled through a hole in a barbed wire fence, climbed a 20ft concrete cable abutment, and fell to the frozen ground below. But that theory makes no sense to Holly&#8217;s friends and family, who spend the next ten years trying to understand what happened to Holly Bartlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>BWBRSA: Operation Fireball</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;We\'re dropping in your feed on an unusual day of the week to tell you an unusual Crime Junkie story. Thanks to the podcast Something Was Wrong, Ashley stumbled across a story that shook her to her core.

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Butcher Baker of Alaska</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Hansen owned and operated a successful bakery in Anchorage, Alaska in the 1970s and 80s, selling donuts and danishes to everyone in town. He was a well-known and well-respected member of the business community, living in a nice home in the suburbs with his wife and two children. In his spare time, he liked to fly his plane to the remote area around the Knik River and hunt for wolves and caribou and other large game. But sometimes the wild animals just weren&#8217;t enough. He needed something else to hunt, to chase along the river flats, to stalk and kill.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2006&#160;Rey Rivera was found dead at the Belvedere Hotel in Baltimore.&#160;Did he die by suicide, or was something more sinister at play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the release of this episode, representatives of Porter Stansberry contacted Crime Junkie to inform us of information regarding Rey Rivera&#8217;s case that had not yet been made public, and we want to alert our listeners to that information for the sake of being exhaustive. Not only did Porter Stansberry offer a reward to find Rey, he also hired a private detective to lead the search for Rey.&#160;Although previously reported accounts suggested that Porter did not cooperate with police, this appears not to have been correct.&#160;Porter did urge all of his employees and even all of his company&#8217;s clients to contact the police with any information about Rey&#8217;s whereabouts.&#160;After Rey&#8217;s body was found, Porter never issued a gag order telling employees not to help the police.&#160;Porter in fact fully cooperated with the Police after Rey&#8217;s body was found, including being interviewed by the lead detective in the case on June 23rd 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>CAPTURED: The Monster of Miramichi</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Allan Legere was serving a life sentence for the murder of an elderly shopkeeper in a rural part of New Brunswick, Canada. Until he escaped. For seven months, he evaded capture, living in the woods around the Miramichi river, only coming out at night to steal food, rob houses, and murder the community&#8217;s most vulnerable citizens. More than 30 years later, people still remember the fear and panic that gripped a community, caused by one man - the&#160;Monster&#160;of the Miramichi.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;During spring break of 1975, Sheila &amp; Kate Lyon went missing from a shopping center near their home and for almost 40 years no one knew what happened to them. Over the years horrible men would come into focus as suspects. Men who took the lives of 10-year-old Amanda Ray, 5-year-old Neely Smith, and 15-year-old Kathy Beatty. But it wasn\'t until a cold case investigator came across a single old report from 1975 (a report that had been there all along) that the case would finally be solved and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Lyon would finally have answers about what happened to their daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>INFAMOUS: Alice Crimmins</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Long before Casey Anthony, there was another mother America loved to hate... Alice Crimmins. When her children went missing from their room one summer night, the police and the press were quick to point the finger at the "sex-crazed" mother. At the start of the women\'s lib movement, Alice stood for everything that threatened the status quo of how a wife and mother should behave. But over 50 years later we can re-examine the case and her multiple trials to see if there really was a case against Alice or if she was the victim of a witch hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In March of 1998 Amy Lynn Bradley and her family set off and what was to be the trip of a lifetime, a full week-long cruise around the Caribbean. But little did they know their dream vacation would turn into a nightmare when Amy goes missing from their stateroom in the early morning hours of March 24, 1998. Over 20 years have passed and clues of her fate are few and far between but there have been credible sightings to suggest that Amy is alive and being held captive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

Police have spent decades trying to piece together what happened to Mischelle that night. Who would she have pulled over for? Where was she headed? And even though a man served 16 years for her murder the current sherriff is convinced they still have not captured Mishelle\'s killer and it could all be tied back to the man... or men... who initially found her car.&#160; &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>WANTED: Austin Yogurt Shop Killer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the early 90\'s, Austin, TX was turned upside down when four young girls were sexually assaulted, murdered, then set on fire inside an ICBY store. Four men were accused of the crime, but there have always been questions around their guilt. Those questions have only been amplified in recent years as new DNA technology as revealed an unknown perpetrator\'s DNA at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is probably the strangest case of murder we have ever covered here on Crime Junkie.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we have two stories for you of men who are wanted for killing their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our first story is about a man named Bradford Bishop, a man who, after not receiving a promotion at work, went home, and methodically killed his entire family. Officials believe he then fled the country and has been living out his days in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second story is about a man named Yaser Said who is still on the FBI\'s 10 most wanted list for murdering his two daughters in the back of his cab. His daughter died while on the phone with 911 trying to get help, but they couldn\'t get to her in time. The FBI believe Yasser is now living in NYC and working as a cab driver.&lt;br /&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MISSING: Maura Murray (Part 1)</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2004 a 21-year-old UMass student, Maura Murray, sends a message to her professors saying there has been a death in her family and she will be out for the next week.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s, three women were murdered after attending the same nightclub. But aside from their location, all three women had something very specific in common. Was this thing they had in common the reason they were killed or was their killer, a man now known as Bible John, after them because they were frequenting a nightclub known for hookups and infidelity? It is now decades later and police are still looking for a red-haired man last seen with all three women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 1992, Mischelle Lawless was found by passersbys deceased in her car with the headlights on and the vehicle still running.

And even though a man served 16 years for her murder the current sheriff is convinced they still have not captured Mischelle\'s killer and it could all be tied back to the man... or men... who initially found her car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Claremont Killer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 1996, people in Claremont had been looking over their shoulders when they go out for a night on the town. Over the span of a few years, three girls were taken from the same place in nearly identical fashions. Many years later, those crimes would be connected to other attacks dating back to 1988. And somehow, in 2016, a man was arrested for these crimes... But we still don\'t know exactly how police got his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MISSING: Sage Smith</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 20, 2012, Sage Smith left her home at 5:30 for a date. She was seen alone at 6:30 talking to someone on the phone and then possibly sighted one more time at 7:00 at a cafe, again alone. Her father and friends were advocates and attempted to investigate her disappearance on their own, but ended up in the same place where the police ended up. At a dead end. No one has seen her since and police are still looking to speak with the man she last communicated with that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Green River Killer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Through the 80\'s &amp; 90\'s, women in the state of Washington were turning up dead. First, along the Green River, then in other clusters throughout the state and even into Portland, Oregon. Not only had these women been murdered but their killer would re-visit their corpses and sexually assault them multiple times until their corpses were fully decomposed and consumed by maggots. A man named Gary Ridgeway had been pointed out by a number of witnesses as being the Green River Killer but police were unable to make an arrest until DNA connected him to four crime scenes in 2001 &#8211; two decades and at least 49 victims later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

First, along the Green River, then in other clusters throughout the state and even into Portland, Oregon. Not only had these women been murdered but their killer would re-visit their corpses and sexually assault them multiple times until their corpses were fully decomposed and consumed by maggots. A man named Gary Ridgeway had been pointed out by a number of witnesses as being the Green River Killer but police were unable to make an arrest until DNA connected him to four crime scenes in 2001 &#8211; two decades and at least 49 victims later.</itunes:summary>

            <title>MISSING: Misty Copsey</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In September of 1992, a young teenager named Misty Copsey went missing after visiting the local fair in Puyallup, Washington with her best friend. Almost 26 years have passed and all we have are a handful of suspicious suspects and a pair of jeans found at a site that could be linked to a serial killer. Plus, a rogue private citizen, whose efforts to try to solve the case have become an obsession, that might actually be distracting from the real investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>CAPTURED: Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible\'s Killer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&#160;In April of 2018, we were all talking about the capture of the Gold State Killer but did you know another long-time cold case was solved that same week? On December 29, 1999, best friends Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman were having a sleepover at Ashley\'s house. Sometime in the early morning hours of December 30th, Ashley\'s parents were murdered and their home set on fire. The two girls were never seen again. For years, theories surrounded this case. Did Someone take the girls? Were the girls responsible for one or more murders and then ran off to start new lives? Well in 2018 we finally got answers, though, as of this recording their remains have still not been found.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>ADNAN: What Serial Didn\'t Tell You</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of millions of people tuned into Serial season one back in 2014. Sarah Koenig told us all about the story of 18-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee who disappeared on January 13th, 1999. Hae\'s body was later found in Leakin Park, and not too long after the discovery of her body, police zeroed in on their prime suspect: Adnan Syed. Sarah took us all through 12 episodes of "Did he or didn\'t he?" and many of us ended the season with more questions than answers. But did you know that Serial was just the beginning and there was so much that Sarah never covered? If you listened to Serial season one, you must listen to this single episode that sums up the top four points Serial didn\'t tell you, but you need to know before you decide whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. We won\'t be re-covering the Serial story - we jump in assuming you already know it. So, if you haven\'t listened yet, check out the first season of Serial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>WANTED: Monster in Fort Wayne, Indiana</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago this week, a little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was abducted, sexually assaulted, murdered and now, forgotten by everyone. It is one of the most horrific crimes we\'ve ever researched, and yet when we ask people if they know about April Tinsley, we only get blank stares. This man, who police believed was local, not only committed the crime, but taunted police and the community for 16 years after. He could still be walking among us - You could very well know him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MISSING: Kiplyn Davis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1995, one of our listeners from Kentucky was high school pen pals with a girl named Kiplyn Davis from Spanish Fork, Utah, when one day the Spanish Fork Police called looking for answers. Kiplyn had gone missing. Kiplyn\'s story takes over 16 years to unfold and even though a few young men have been accused of and pled guilty to murder, no one has ever found Kiplyn or her remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MURDERED: The Longo Family</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes a seemingly normal family man snap, murder his entire family, and assume a new identity in Mexico? Christian Longo was a husband, and father of three kids, who moved his family to Oregon to escape legal and money trouble he had accrued back in Michigan. But the new start didn\'t take away the pressure of supporting a family on a part-time, minimum wage income. One December day, Christian\'s family is found in the most horrific ways and Christian is nowhere to be found. The prosecution and the public seem pretty clear on what took place the day the Longo family died, but Christian\'s surprise story after he goes to trial is just his final way of disgracing his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>CONSPIRACY: Bardstown, Kentucky</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old woman named Crystal Rogers went missing from Bardstown, KY back in 2015. Her car was found on the side of a busy parkway with a flat tire, keys, wallet, and phone still inside. Just 16 months later, while searching for answers, Crystal\'s father is murdered in cold blood. Now, people are wondering if these two crimes are connected to a bigger conspiracy that started with the murder of a police officer in 2013.

Karina had secrets and shortly before her death she wrote a letter to her friend in Sweden and shared something that would forever haunt those who learn about this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit&#160;&lt;a href="https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/"&gt;https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/&lt;/a&gt;.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.
