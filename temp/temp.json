Season of Justice (SOJ) is dedicated to providing funding to law enforcement agencies and families to help solve cold cases. SOJ provides grants to law enforcement for advanced DNA analysis solutions, such as forensic genealogy and next-generation sequencing. The organization also awards grants to families to support awareness campaigns, search teams and other initiatives that can assist in pushing their cold cases forward. SOJ's goal is to provide financial resources for both law enforcement and families in order to bring closure to those impacted by unsolved violent crimes.Though Season of Justice is completely separate from audiochuck, it's because of Crime Junkie listeners that we have been able to fund the organization so far. Every time you've ordered merch, signed up for the fan club or just listened to one of our ads on Crime Junkie we have donated to SOJ.Because of you we have already been able to award $145,000 in grants to assist with 25 cold cases. And that's JUST the beginning. We expect to award another $75,000 to $100,000 through the rest of this year and hopefully much more in the years to come.At audiochuck, we believe we have a responsibility to do more than just tell these stories. We believe you as listeners have a responsibility to do more than just listen. We really wanted to be able to move the needle in the true crime space and create responsible true crime content and we are doing that together. Because of you and because of this show, we will all be directly responsible for making a difference. For making sure justice is served. For doing right by the people whose stories we tell.Whether you've been here since day one or you just found our show - THANK YOU. Thank you for being a part of this journey. And thank you for helping us making a lasting responsible impact in the true crime space.Audiochuck will always continue to use the funds brought in by our fans to support Season of Justice and other non-profits and cases that are important to us and our listeners, but if you want to donate directly you can visit the website Seasonofjustice.org. Season of Justice is a 501(c)(3) and all donations are tax-deductible. Law enforcement, victims and families can also submit grant applications on the website for funding.One day we hope to wake up and say there are no more cold cases... That won't be tomorrow, but there is a future where that's possible. And thank you for making that happen."

It was 31-year-old Holly Bartlett. Police say she walked almost a quarter of a mile from the front door of her condo building, where she crawled through a hole in a barbed wire fence, climbed a 20ft concrete cable abutment, and fell to the frozen ground below. But that theory makes no sense to Holly's friends and family, who spend the next ten years trying to understand what happened to Holly Bartlett.

He was a well-known and well-respected member of the business community, living in a nice home in the suburbs with his wife and two children. In his spare time, he liked to fly his plane to the remote area around the Knik River and hunt for wolves and caribou and other large game. But sometimes the wild animals just weren't enough. He needed something else to hunt, to chase along the river flats, to stalk and kill. For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/.

Did he die by suicide, or was something more sinister at play?Following the release of this episode, representatives of Porter Stansberry contacted Crime Junkie to inform us of information regarding Rey Rivera's case that had not yet been made public, and we want to alert our listeners to that information for the sake of being exhaustive. Not only did Porter Stansberry offer a reward to find Rey, he also hired a private detective to lead the search for Rey. Although previously reported accounts suggested that Porter did not cooperate with police, this appears not to have been correct. Porter did urge all of his employees and even all of his company's clients to contact the police with any information about Rey's whereabouts. After Rey's body was found, Porter never issued a gag order telling employees not to help the police. Porter in fact fully cooperated with the Police after Rey's body was found, including being interviewed by the lead detective in the case on June 23rd 2006.

Christian Longo was a husband, and father of three kids, who moved his family to Oregon to escape legal and money trouble he had accrued back in Michigan. But the new start didn 't take away the pressure of supporting a family on a part-time, minimum wage income. One December day, Christian 's family is found in the most horrific ways and Christian is nowhere to be found. The prosecution and the public seem pretty clear on what took place the day the Longo family died, but Christian 's surprise story after he goes to trial is just his final way of disgracing his family.
